...as a result, ice cream has evolved
into a pretty unique consumer good,

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,875
in the sense that customers are
allowed (or even encouraged) to have

3
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:13,208
pretty idiosyncratic preferences,
that the industry is nevertheless
happy to cater to.

4
00:00:13,208 --> 00:00:17,833
But in any case, according to a
2017 study by the IDFA,

5
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:21,000
America's leading Dairy Industry
lobby group,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,458
the five best-selling American
Ice Cream flavors these days are:

7
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:33,416
...and Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough.

8
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:39,291
A 2020 YouGov poll by the American
public, meanwhile, yielded basically
the same results,

9
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:42,916
with the only difference being that
in their list, they also had

10
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:44,833
...and...

11
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:46,333
..."pee-can."

12
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,625
"Pee-cans" are another plant that is
indigenous to North America.

13
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:53,958
According to this book about
the history of "pee-cans,"

14
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:59,333
early European settlers tended to
dismiss "pee-cans" as being basically
the same as walnuts,

15
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:01,833
which they already had in Europe,
so who cares.

16
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:05,416
To this day, America produces over
80% of the world's "pee-cans,"

17
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:07,916
and they're mostly just eaten
by Americans.

You make great videos, J.J.
You were so close.

19
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:15,700
I'm sorry, J.J.
You made me do this.

20
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,991
This is a pecan.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,916
This is a dish of pecans.

22
00:01:23,566 --> 00:01:26,133
These are NOT...

23
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:28,716
..."PEE-CANS!"

24
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,408
THIS... is a "Pea-Can."

25
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:46,291
This is also a "Pee-Can."

26
00:01:47,433 --> 00:01:49,266
*sounds of sloshing liquid*

27
00:01:49,266 --> 00:01:54,708
Yes, I urinated in this can
just to make this point.

28
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:56,666
Now, let me be completely clear.

29
00:01:56,666 --> 00:02:01,033
This is not an opinion.
This is not an argument.

30
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:06,300
"Puh-kaanz" is an OBJECTIVELY
better pronunciation,

31
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:11,541
because "Pee-cans" sounds
D I S G U S T I N G !

32
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:15,100
And pecans don't deserve a
disgusting conotation.

33
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,391
After all, they're delicious!
Don't you agree?
