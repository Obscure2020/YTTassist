<!-- As displayed in "Test002 - Result.png", this one worked as expected! This is excellent. -->
<!-- Also of note are the ways YouTube modified the file. YouTube seems to like to reorder my <wp> tags to be not in order of id. -->
<!-- YouTube also seems to be adding in a <wp> with an id of 0. Now, I could start my own counting with 0, but I'm torn. -->
<!-- Before I started conducting my testing, I encountered one example where a <wp> with an id of 0 was NOT generated. -->
<!-- Erring on the side of caution, I think I'll start my counting at 1 as a rule here. -->
<!-- If YouTube wants to add extra useless information to the subtitle file, they can go right ahead. I couldn't care less. -->
<!-- After all, they have practically infinite storage space. -->
